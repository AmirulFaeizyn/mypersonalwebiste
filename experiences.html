		<p>When I finished the SPM examination, I applied to the 7-Eleven convenience store near my grandparents house at Bandar Pasir Mas. I start work there from May 2020 until October 2020 during my SPM result release date. From day 1 until end, I have learn a lot of experiences especially in facing the customers.</p>

		<p>During I work there, I'have met many good workmate because when have a rest time, we pray together, go out to eat together, and sharing opinion to each other. My boss is a person with integrity and fun. </p>

		<p>Along the experiences, I have learn about how to treat or serve the customers, restore the goods, arranging and cleaning up the store.To conclude, from there I start to improving my soft skills in business.</p>
